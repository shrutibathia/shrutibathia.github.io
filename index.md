I am a fifth-year PhD student in Social Research Methodology at the Graduate School of Education, University of California Berkeley. My research focusses on exploring inequalities in education especially pertaining to the Latino children in United States. I believe that the undeniable relationship between racial inequalities and educational inequalities represents a societal failure that betrays the spirit of humanity.  Some of the macro issues that I am looking at are – the changing patterns of racial and economic segregation over the past decade. Some of the micro issues that I am looking at are the effect of stereotype threat on educational outcomes. 
Prior to UC Berkeley, I worked in Hewlett Packard as a Business Analyst. While at HP, I was teaching at a school for the underprivileged. It made me realize that education is inherently unfair – the children who start behind stay behind. In January 2015, I moved out of a corporate career to understand the nuances of the field of education and delve into the application of data analytics to the same.  My unique background in engineering with an emphasis on mathematics, my graduate degree in education coupled with my work experience in statistics and analytics gives me a unique blend of theory and skills. 
At UC Berkeley, I have taken courses on multilevel modeling, causal inference, measurement, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis and program evaluation. I have extensively used R and STATA for statistical analysis in my projects and coursework. I am also well versed with Conquest (a software for Item Response Theory Analysis) & MS Excel.
