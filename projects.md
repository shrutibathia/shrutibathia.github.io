In the Computational Social Science Project 1 , I got familiar with the basic concepts of Github. I learnt how to create repository, add new files and commit changes. The advantage of Git is version control and effective collaboration. 
Finally, I learnt how to create this personal website which will be modified in future.

Cheers!
