In the Computational Social Science Project 1 , I got familiar with the basic concepts of Github. I learnt how to create repository, add new files and commit changes. The advantage of Git is version control and effective collaboration. 
Finally, we learnt how to create this personal website which will be modified in future.

Cheers!
